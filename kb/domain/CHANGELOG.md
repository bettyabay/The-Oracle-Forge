# Domain KB Changelog

## 2026-04-11

- Initialized domain KB directory and changelog.
- Added `join_keys.md`.
- Added `text_fields.md`.

## 2026-04-14

- Full population from DAB db_description files across all 12 datasets.
- Added the Yahoo-like Yelp-specific join and extraction notes for `businessid_*` -> `businessref_*` normalization and city/state preference.

## Injection Test

Query run:
Test the Yelp domain KB against the actual benchmark queries that rely on business identity mapping, city/state filtering, and category extraction.

Expected answer:
The domain KB should preserve the business identity convention (`businessid_*` -> `businessref_*`), interpret Yelp location fields correctly, and keep category names stable enough for validator matching.

Observed failure:
Before the domain prompt and query-rule updates, the agent repeatedly tried direct or malformed joins, or relied only on description text, which caused empty or incorrect intermediate results.

Fix applied:
Updated the domain KB notes and the shared prompt so the agent prefers exact city/state fields when present, and converts `businessid_*` to `businessref_*` before review-table joins.

Outcome / Post-fix verification:
The shared-server Yelp smoke set passed with concrete results:
- q1: `3.55`
- q2: `PA, 3.70`
- q3: `35`
- q4: `Restaurant, 3.63`
- q5: `PA, 3.48`
- q6: `Coffee House Too Cafe, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Cafes`
- q7: `Restaurants / Food / American (New) / Shopping / Breakfast & Brunch`

Status: pass

Notes:
- Verified on the shared server after syncing the remote local Yelp data bundle and updating the agent prompt/fast path.
